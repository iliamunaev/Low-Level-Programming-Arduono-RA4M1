# LED Blink
## 1. LED Blink Direct Register Access
Blinks an LED connected to pin P102 by directly manipulating the microcontroller's registers.  


**Low-Level Code:** [led_blink_direct_register.ino](led_blink_direct_register.ino)

## 2. Execution Time Comparison
Measures and compares the execution time of Arduino API digitalWrite() function versus direct register access for controlling an LED and prints the results to the Serial Monitor.
