# LED Blink
## 1. LED Blink Direct Register Access
Blinks an LED connected to pin P102 by directly manipulating the microcontroller's registers.  


**Low-Level Code:** [led_blink.ino](led_blink.ino)

## 2. Execution Time Comparison
Measures and compares the execution time of Arduino API digitalWrite() function versus direct register access for controlling an LED and prints the results to the Serial Monitor.  

**Low-Level Code:** [performance_test.ino](performance_test.ino)

## Usage
Ready to use via Arduino IDE: copy and flash the desired .ino files to your board.
